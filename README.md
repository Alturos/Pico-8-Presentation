# Pico-8-Presentation
The companion projects to the Start Making Games With Pico-8 talk

This repository contains a series of demo Pico-8 cartridges that build off of each other. Each adds a menu option that will load the next cartridge in the series. Each cartridge contains all the sprites and code necessary to run in Pico-8. The code is heavily commented with information relevant to each particular demo, building off of the one before.

The demos are as follows, in order:

- Template: _a basic starting point for a Pico-8 game_
- Sprite: _use spr() to draw a sprite from the spritesheet_
- Map: _use map() draw a tilemap_
- Animation: _animate a simple sprite_
- Control: _use btn() to move a sprite with the d-pad_
- Jump: _use btn() to add a jump_
- Scrolling: _use camera() to scroll the map_
- Simple Collisions: _add some simple sprite->map collision detection_
- Sounds: _use sfx() to add some simple sound effects_
- Parallax: _add some parallax scrolling with different maps_

Todo:

- Music: _use music() to add some music_
